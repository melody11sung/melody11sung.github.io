### "What Hedge Funds Really Do" by Philip J. Romero and Tucker Balch
### Chapter 7: Framework for Investing: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

#### CAPM
* Developed by Merton Miller, Franco Modigliani, and William Sharpe, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990.
* CAPM provides a rigorous framework for appraising and designing portfolios.
* The model is influential in both academic finance and practical investment management.


#### Basic Premise of CAPM
* CAPM assumes markets are efficient, meaning that asset prices reflect all avialable information.
* Investors cannot consistently achieve returns highter than market averages without taking on additional risk.

* According to CAPM, buying a broad market index (e.g. S&P 500) is a strategy likely to yield superior results compareed to most other strategies.
* Hedge funds challenge this vieew by seeking to outperform market indicies through active management.


#### Core components oof CAPM
* CAPM calculates the expecteed return of an asset based on its risk relativee to the overall market.
* E(Ri) = Rf + beta(E(Rm) - Rf)
* where E(Ri) is the expected return of the asset,
* Rf is the risk-free rate,
* beta is the beta of the asset (a measure of its volatility relative to the market),
* E(Rm) is the expeccted return of the market,
* (E(Rm) - Rf) is the market risk premium.

* Beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market,
* and beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility than the market.


#### Systematic vs. Unsystematic risk
* Systematic risk is risk interent to the entire market or market segment.
* it cannot be diversified away.

* Unsystematic risk is specific to a particular company or industry.
* it can be reduced through diversification.


#### Security Markeet Line (SML)
* Graphical representation: the SML plots expected return of assets against their beta.
* The slope of the SML represents the market risk premium.
* E(Ri) = Rf + beta(E(Rm) - Rf)
  
* Assets above the SML are undervalued (offering higher return for their risk),
* and below the SML are overvalued (offering lower return).


#### Practical application
* CAPM helps in constructing portfolios that balance expected return with risk.
* It provides a basis for comparing the attractiveness of different investments.


#### Limitations
* assums investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate.
* assums all investors have the same expectations and hold the market portfolio.
* does not account for anomalies like momentum and size effeccts.
