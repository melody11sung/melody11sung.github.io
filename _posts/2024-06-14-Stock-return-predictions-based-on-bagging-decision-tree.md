[Stock Return Prediction Based on Bagging-Decision Tree](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5408165)


##### Background
The prediction of stock returns is a significant area of financial study, and decision trees are popular due to their intelligibility and simplicity. The paper aims to enhance the accuracy of decision trees using the Bagging technique.


##### Data and Methodology
The authors use 50 financial ratios from Chinese listed companies' financial statements. The prediction model aims to forecast changes in earnings per share (EPS). The Bagging technique involves creating multiple iterations of training sets to improve the robustness of the decision tree model.


##### Algorithms Compared**: The study compares three models:
   - Basic Decision Tree
   - Bagging-Decision Tree
   - Boosting-Decision Tree


##### Findings
The Bagging-Decision Tree model shows better accuracy in predicting stock returns compared to the other models. Specifically, it achieves a classification accuracy of 61.87%, outperforming the standard and Boosting decision tree models.


##### Implications
The improved model is effective in the context of the Chinese stock market, which is characterized by rapid growth and instability. The findings suggest that Bagging improves predictive performance and reduces computation time.


##### Conclusion
The study concludes that the Bagging-Decision Tree is a viable method for stock return prediction, particularly in emerging markets like China. The model's effectiveness could improve with more data and advancements in forecasting technologies.

The authors emphasize the importance of financial statement analysis and the potential of data mining techniques in enhancing predictive models for financial performance.
