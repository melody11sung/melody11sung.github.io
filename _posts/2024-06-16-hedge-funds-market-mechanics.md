This is a summary made for ML4T class, 
referencing a book "What hedge funds really do: an introduction to portfolio management" (2014) by Romero and Balch.


## 1. Basics of Market Making
* Market makers are entities or individuals that provide liquidity to markets by being ready to buy and sell securities at any time.
* They profit from the bid-ask spread, the difference between the buying price (bid) and the selling price (ask).


## 2. Order Books
* An order book is a list of buy and sell orders for a particular security organized by price level.
* The order book is dynamic, with prices and volumes constantly changing as new orders are placed and old ones are filled or canceled.


## 3. High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
1) Execution Speed:
  * Speed is crucial in market-making, with firms investing heavily in technology to reduce latency.
  * Techniques include the use of fiber optic cables and co-location of servers near exchanges to gain milliseconds of advantage.

2) Front Running:
  * Front running involves executing orders based on advanced knowledge of upcoming client orders.
  * While unethical when trading against clients, it is acceptable when the counterparty is another broker's client.
  * HFT firms use speed to process large numbers of trades quickly and exploit short-term price trends.


## 4. Dark Pools
* Dark pools are private exchanges where trading volumes and prices are not publicly visible.
* They offer anonymity and reduced transaction costs but lack transparency compared to public exchanges.
* Regulatory attempts to force all trading onto public exchanges are often circumvented by technological innovations and new trading forms.


## 5. Market Impact and Strategy
* Order Imbalance: Discrepancies between buy and sell orders can predict short-term price trends, providing valuable information for market makers.
* Trade Execution: Automated trading systems execute trades faster than humans, leveraging technology to maintain a competitive edge.
* Information Asymmetry: Market makers and brokers with access to order books can exploit information asymmetries to their advantage.
