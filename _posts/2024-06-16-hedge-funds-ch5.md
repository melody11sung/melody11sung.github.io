### "What Hedge Funds Really Do" by Philip J. Romero and Tucker Balch
### Chapter 5: Introduction to Company Valuation

#### 1. Company Valuation
* Successfull investments hinge on having a more accurate view of an asset's true value than the seller.
* Different market participants have varying views of value, creating investment opportunities.

#### 2. Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis
* Fundamental Analysis: Based on a company's business operations and finances.
* Technical Analysis: Also known as "charting", this method focuses on historical price patterns and market data.


#### 3. Key valuation methods
##### 3-1. Book Value
* An estimate based on the sum of a company's assets and liabilities.
* Represents the net asset value (NAV) per share.
* Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

##### 3-2. Intrinsic Value
* An estimate based on future dividends to be paid by the company.
* Uses the Divident Discount Model (DDM) which calculates the preesent value of expected future dividents.
* Intrinsic Value = D / (r - g)
* where D is the expected dividend per share, r is the reequired rate of return, and g is the growth rate of dividends.

*** Required rate of return: the minimum rate of return an investor expects to recieve from an investment to compensate for its risk.
*** Required rate of return = risk-free rate (ex. U.S. Treasury bonds) + risk premium (additional return to compensate the risk)


##### 3-3. Earnings Growth
* Projects future earnings to estimate the company's value.
* Often involves models like the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio.
* Earnings Grouth Valuation = Current Earnings X (1 + g)^n
* where g is the growth rate and n is the number of years.


#### 4. Market Efficiency and inefficiencies
##### Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
* Asserts that financial markets are efficient in reflecting all available information in asset prices.
* Despite this, hedge funds seek to exploit occasional inefficiencies where prices diverge from true values.

##### Investment opportunities
* Appear when the current price of an asset diverges from the investor's estimate of its true value.
* Opportunities for going long (if undervalued), or short (if overvalued).


#### 5. Margin of safety
* popularized by Benjamin Graham, it involves buying stocks well below their intrinsic value to ensure a "margin of safety".
* this approach minimizes downside risk and maximizes potential returns.


#### 6. Application of valuation methods
* Fundamental Analysis techniques: used by investors to independently value companies and identify discrepancies between market price and true value.
* Critical for making informed investment decisions.


#### 7. Examples and case studies
* If total assets are $10 million, and total liabilities are $4 million, 
* then the company's book value is $6 million.
* If there are 1 million shares, the book value per share is $6.

* If expected dividend (D) is $2 per sharee, required rate of return (r) is 8%, and growth rate (g) is 3%,
* then the intrinsic value = $2 / (0.08 - 0.03) = $40 per share
