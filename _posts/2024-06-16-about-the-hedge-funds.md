This is a summary made for ML4T class, referencing a book "What hedge funds really do: an introduction to portfolio management" (2014) by Romero and Balch.
  
## 1. Understanding Hedge Funds
  
1) Definition and Role:
  - Hedge funds are private pools of capital from accredited investors.
  - They are exempt from most regulations that apply to mutual funds
  
2) Investing Basics:
  - Hedge funds play a crucial role in redeploying capital to achieve the best returns.
  - Their economic function is to use capital efficiently by moving it from low-return to high-return assets.

  
## 2. Types of Investors and Regulation

1) Accredited Investors:
  - Hedge funds accept money from accredited investors, who are wealthy individuals or institutions presumed to be sophisticated enough to handle the risks involved.
  
2) Regulatory Exemptions:
  - Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds are not subject to strict regulations due to their investor base.
  - They are prohibited from advertising and rely heavily on secrecy to maintain a competitive edge.


## 3. Hedge Fund Strategies

1) Equity Strategies:
  - Focus on stock selection, including long/short strategies.
  - Long/short strategies involve buying undervalued stocks and shorting overvalued ones.
    
2) Arbitrage:
  - Exploits price discrepancies between related assets.
  - Types include fixed income arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and statistical arbitrage.
    
3) Event-Driven Strategies:
  - Based on specific events like mergers, acquisitions, or financial distress.
  - Examples include merger arbitrage and distressed asset investing.
    
4) Global Macro:
  - Based on macroeconomic views of the world’s economies.
  - Trades in a wide range of markets and instruments.


## 4. Hedge Fund Fees

- Commonly known as “2 and 20” – 2% of assets under management (AUM) and 20% of profits.
- Compensation Example:
  - Managing a hedge fund with $100,000,000 AUM growing by 15% in a year results in a total compensation of about $5,000,000 (2% of AUM + 20% of profits).
- Some funds charge even higher performance fees, especially those with superior reputations.


## 5. Performance and Risks

1) Return Calculation:
  - Returns are measured by comparing the value of holdings at the beginning and end of a time period.
  - Annual returns can be computed using compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
  
2) Risk Measurement:
  - Volatility is measured using standard deviation of returns.
  - Hedge funds aim to reduce volatility and deliver consistent returns.
  - The Sharpe Ratio is used to assess the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio, calculated as (return - risk-free rate) / standard deviation of the portfolio.


## 6. Hedge Fund Evaluation

1) Absolute vs. Relative Return:
  - Absolute return: The actual return of the fund without comparison to any benchmark.
  - Relative return: The return compared to a benchmark index like the S&P 500.
  - Alpha: Measures a fund’s performance relative to a benchmark, indicating investing skill.


## 7. Market Making and Trading Mechanics

1) Order Types:
  - Market Orders: Buy or sell at the current market price.
  - Limit Orders: Buy or sell only at a specified price or better.
  - Short Selling: Borrowing shares to sell now and repurchase them later at a lower price.
  
2) Order Book:
  - Contains all buy and sell orders at different price levels.
  - The bid-ask spread indicates the liquidity of the market.

  - From the above example, price is likely to drop because there is more selling pressure than buying pressure.

  
## 8. Secrecy and Intellectual Property

1) Secrecy:
  - Hedge funds keep their strategies secret to prevent competitors from copying them.
  - They often report their holdings and strategies only in broad terms to investors and after the fact.

2) Intellectual Property:
  - Strategies and models used by hedge funds are difficult to patent, making secrecy crucial.
